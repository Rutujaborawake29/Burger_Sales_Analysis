Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a small dataset of burgers to determine which type of burger, veg or non-veg, sells more. The dataset contains three columns: id, burger_name, and category. The objective is to improve sales by understanding consumer preferences for veg or non-veg burgers.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each burger sale.
burger_name: Name of the burger sold.
category: Category of the burger (veg or non-veg).
Analysis
Data Preparation: A sample dataset with records was created, containing both veg and non-veg burgers.
Data Aggregation: The number of veg and non-veg burgers sold was counted.
Visualization: A bar chart was plotted to visualize the sales of veg and non-veg burgers.
Findings
The analysis revealed that veg burgers are sold more than non-veg burgers. This insight can help in strategizing sales improvement by focusing more on veg burger offerings, promotions, and marketing campaigns.

Conclusion
Veg burgers are more popular among consumers, indicating a preference for vegetarian options. To improve sales, it is recommended to:

Increase the variety of veg burgers.
